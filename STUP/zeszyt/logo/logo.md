# How to make a good logo

Key qualities you should aspire to in your tech startup logo:

- Relevance: Your logo’s visual language should be a representation of your business offer. 
- Distinctiveness: A logo that is unique and differentiated from the competition creates a stronger visual impact, helping your business stand out.
- Simplicity: The simpler the logo, the more memorable it will be. While it can be tempting to go in-depth about all of your startup’s different services and nuances, it’s better to encapsulate a single, well-defined idea.
- Scalability: Your logo should look its best on every possible medium, both digital and physical. From desktop to mobile, and from billboards to business cards, ensure that your logo is versatile and fitting for all sizes and applications.

Now the bird is less "lean", make it more lean

This is what I really like, we are close. The last adjustments are about colors (make it more woodpecker-like) and the size. Now it is square, but i want to show the speed with a shape that has more width than height (in ratio 2 to 1)
